# DevOps Goodies
The idea of this repo is to gather a few example configurations/ideas that I've created during my daily work as a devops engineer.

Most of my applications are built with PHP (Laravel) and the CI platform of choice is GitLab. For production environments I usually use VMs or OpenShift.
